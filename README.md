# Resume
> ### This is my first github project with the use of SASS pre-processor.

##### The purpose of this resume is to showcase the knowledge i have grasped while using github and sass along with webpack.


### Features:
* Partials (variables, mixins)
  * Before Sass my css files used to be cluttered with lines of code, however with use of sass partials and mixins my css file looks really clean and easy to manage.
  * I can change the button colors or font size while just editing it's variable & mixin files instead of searching through my earlier endless css codes.
  * You get to see all styles of fonts or colors i have used in my project just by looking into one file ie: partials, mixins.
* Switch Themes 
  * Sass is very helpful to create and maintain different themes.
  * I have learned and used this as a base for my resume so as to understand how it actually works in real scenario.
* Loaders
* Media Queries
